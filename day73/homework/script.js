// scopes JavaScript - we have local, global and block scope also if we don't have local scope we can use global scope
// block scope - is inside a block of code
// local scope - is inside a function
// global scope - is outside a function

// hosting - hosting is only working with var keyword and functions. It means that you can use a variable or function before it is declared because of hosting functions are move to top of the code and var keyword is defained as defined top of the code but as undefined.
